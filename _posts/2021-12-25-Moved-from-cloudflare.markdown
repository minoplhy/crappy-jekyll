Hello, this is Crappyâ€™s Blog as usual . I wrote this blog to says that i moved from Cloudflare to another DNS Provider now

## Why?
Mainly, useless for my position and part of my **de-cloudflare** project

## New Provider
1984.is FreeDNS,
My only Criteria is support DNSSEC,
Unfortunately my Registrar doesn't support Yet and I've problem addding multiple MX Records on the same domain in desec so, i moved to 1984 FreeDNS . This Decision might be forever or until i find another great provider

## Moving of Landing Page Builder
Actualy, i moved from Cloudflare Pages to surge But, they doesn't Yet support IPV6 and their cert Provision seem a bit confusing so, i moved to Netlify instead

## Footer
I don't know if this only me or someone else too. But since i change my DNS Provider, My DNS Response for +Wildcard+.1w1.one a lot worse than before. Don't known what cause this But, I'm looking into this
*update: It's not my fault, It's network fault!*
